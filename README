LXLauncher is an open source clone of Asus launcher for EeePC.
It outperformes the original launcher developed by Xandros.

Background images used by Asus launcher are non-free and are
hence not included in this package.

Notes for compilation: it requires intltool, GTK+ 2.12 or newer,
libstartup-notification and libmenu-cache for compilation.

Please put the images in /usr/share/lxlauncher/background/.
LXLauncher will use those background images if available for any page
which has appropriate ID - the image name should be <ID>.jpg, for
example Work.jpg, or Internet.jpg, etc.

Also, if you put the tab icons of Asus launcher under 
/usr/share/lxlauncher/icons, they will be used in the tabs.
Otherwise, some icons from the gtk+ icon theme will be used instead.

The LXLauncher has three configuration files to be tuned by users:

1) ~/.config/lxlauncher/settings.conf which is an init-style file with
contents defaults as below:

[Main]
BUTTON_SIZE = 120
IMG_SIZE = 48

2) ~/.config/lxlauncher/gtkrc which is a GTK+ 2 RC file with custom style.

3) ~/.config/lxlauncher/gtk.css which is a GTK+ 3 CSS file with custom style.

Also one additional setting can be set in global GTK settings:

lxlauncher-enable-key

which is a boolean parameter that allows users if set to true to use
up/down/left/right/tab/enter keys to operate the lxlauncher. Default
value for it is false.
